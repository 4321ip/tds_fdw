Description:
This is a PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper for use to connect to databases that use TDS,
such as Sybase databases and Microsoft SQL server.

This foreign data wrapper requires requires a library that uses the DB-Library interface,
such as FreeTDS (http://www.freetds.org/). This has been tested with FreeTDS, but not
the proprietary implementations of DB-Library.
